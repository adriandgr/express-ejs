##Exercise
You've learned how to use Node's http module to create a simple client that retrieves information from an existing server. This exercise finds you on the other end of http, where you will create a web server that sends back http responses. More specifically, you will create a web server that sends back HTML.

Go through the following external tutorial in detail, please:

**However, please read the tips below first.**

## Tips
- Do not copy/paste the code; Write it out instead.
- This external tutorial makes ample use of the ES6 keyword const, in place of var. We will be covering const very soon. Until then, you are free to interpret these as vars.
- This external tutorial also makes use of ES6 arrow functions, which are covered later. You can choose to follow along or write the forEach using previously encountered (ES5) anonymous in-line callback function syntax. This may help.
- If you've made changes to the code and do not see them take affect when refreshing the page, remember to restart the node process. Any changes to .js (node) code will require you to restart the process.
- Go slow and feel free to research (read: Google) for explanations or documentation for words or concepts covered in this tutorial.
